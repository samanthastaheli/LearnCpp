# LearnCpp

## Overview

This repository is a collection of simple programs that helped me learn C++. There is a program for every topic I learned, such as variables, data structures, functions, and classes.

TODO: {Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}

The purpose of writing this software was to learn the basics of C++. 

I learned C++ because it is a powerful language that is commonly used in software development. It is a lower level programming language that can be used as a functional, object oriented, procedural, and more. 

TODO: {Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

A demo video is linked bellow.

## Development Environment

Visual Studio is a viable IDE for C++ development. Unlike VS Code, Visual Studio has a built in C++ complier, which makes C++ development convenient.

I did not use any libraries Since I am new to this programming language, I focused on the main concepts

## Future Work

TODO: {Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

There are some things that I did not get to that I would like to learn in the future.
* game development
* libraries
* recursion
  * My fibonacci program uses recursion. It doesn't work yet, so I need to fix the recursion.  
* import other C++ files
* Binary trees
