# LearnCpp

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
This repository is a collection of simple programs that helped me learn C++. There is a program for every topic I learned, such as variables, data structures, functions, and classes. I learned C++ because it is a powerful language that is commonly used in software development. It is a lower-level programming language that can be used for functional programming, object-oriented programming, procedural programming, and more. 

[HelloWorld](https://github.com/samanthastaheli/LearnCpp/blob/main/HelloWorld.cpp) is the first C++ code I wrote. If you didn't gather from the file name, it is a simple function that prints "Hello World!" in the terminal. 

The purpose of the [useFunctions](https://github.com/samanthastaheli/LearnCpp/blob/main/useFunctions.cpp), [VarTypes](https://github.com/samanthastaheli/LearnCpp/blob/main/VarTypes.cpp), [useClasses](https://github.com/samanthastaheli/LearnCpp/blob/main/useClasses.cpp), [useStruct](https://github.com/samanthastaheli/LearnCpp/blob/main/useStruct.cpp), [useLambda](https://github.com/samanthastaheli/LearnCpp/blob/main/useLambda.cpp), and [userInput](https://github.com/samanthastaheli/LearnCpp/blob/main/userInput.cpp) programs was to learn the basics of C++. Each program demonstrates a different element of C++. For example, VarTypes creates and prints different types of variables that can be used in C++. From making these programs I was able to utilize the basic elements I learned to create [factorial](https://github.com/samanthastaheli/LearnCpp/blob/main/factorial.cpp), [findPrimes](https://github.com/samanthastaheli/LearnCpp/blob/main/findPrimes.cpp), and [fibonacci](https://github.com/samanthastaheli/LearnCpp/blob/main/fibonacci.cpp) programs.

A slightly more intricate program in this repository is the [calculator](https://github.com/samanthastaheli/LearnCpp/blob/main/calculator.cpp). It is composed of multiple functions and utilizes while loops, if statements, mathematical operators, and user input.

Each program demonstartes a different element of C++. For example, VarTypes creates amd prints different types of variables that can be used in C++ ([link to VarTypes.cpp](VarTypes.cpp)).

## Development Environment

Visual Studio is a viable IDE for C++ development. Unlike VS Code, Visual Studio has a built in C++ compiler, which makes C++ development convenient.

I did not use any libraries since I am new to this programming language. Instead, I focused on the main concepts.

## Future Work

The following list is some things that I did not get to that I would like to learn in the future.

* Game development
* Libraries
* Recursion
  * My Fibonacci program uses recursion. It doesn't work yet, so I need to fix the recursion.  
* Import other C++ files
* Binary trees
